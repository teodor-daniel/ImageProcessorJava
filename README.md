# ImageProcessorJava

An interesting Java application designed for basic image processing, specifically focusing on zooming functionalities. This application allows users to either zoom in or zoom out of images using the Zero Order Hold (ZOH) method, also known as Nearest-Neighbor interpolation. Users can choose between applying a single zoom operation or multiple consecutive zooms with varying factors for a customized effect. The design pattern for the thread action is called consumer/producer.

## How to Use:

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the source directory.
2. **Compile** the Java files.
3. **Run** the test.Main class and follow the on-screen prompts to select the image file and desired operations.
